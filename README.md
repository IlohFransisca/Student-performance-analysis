# Student's Performance Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing the performance of students using multiple linear regression algorithms. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, consists of 10,000 records and 6 columns. The aim is to understand the impact of various factors on student performance.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:
- **Hours Studied**
- **Previous Scores**
- **Extracurricular Activities**
- **Sleep Hours**
- **Sample Question Papers Practiced**
- **Performance Index**

The shape of the dataset is `(10000, 6)`.
